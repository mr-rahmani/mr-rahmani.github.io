**Welcome!**  

I am a Ph.D. Candidate  in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, supervised by [Dr. Aref](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SATq2T4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Yassaee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en). My main fields of research are information theory, high dimensional statistics, machine learning theory and quantum information theory. I am interested in various topics in these field including fundamental limits in estimation problems, covariance matrix estimation, foundations of quantum physics, quantum tomography, quantum Shannon theory and quantum machine learning.
